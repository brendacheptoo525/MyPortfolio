                        <p>Worked on a project tracking system to help Moringa School technical mentors manage student projects across different class cohorts efficiently. Technical mentors can add or delete student projects based on the cohorts, while students have the ability to view existing projects and add new projects along with their group members. This system ensures organized project management and streamlined collaboration for both mentors and students.Check it out <a href="https://project-tracker-squ8.onrender.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
